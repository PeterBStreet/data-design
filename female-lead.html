		<h>Female Lead</h>
		<div>
			<p>
				I was recently asked by the instructor of my Deep Dive Coding class, who would hire as strong female lead,
				and what personality or physical characteristics would motivate my choice. Immediately, Kirsten Dunst came
				to mind despite the fact that she stared as exceeding cute MJ in the blockbuster “Spiderman trilogy”.
				Remember the 5 year old vampire Claudia in “Interview with a Vampire”? How about the non-Hollywood
				productions “Upside Down” and “Melancholia”? To top it all off she was the voice of Kiki in Studio Ghibli’s
				English release of “Kiki’s Delivery Service”. Ms. Dunst is a great choice. She has navigated a successful
				career as an actor pursuing typical tinsel town cliché as well as independent productions while maintain a
				very private life.

				Then I thought, what has Ms. Dunst done for the greater good of society. Is there a better choice?
				Entertainment is a valuable contribution, but what about making society better? I know that I risk sounding
				like a typical guy. Hey honey! Now that you have cleaned the house, done the laundry, prepared meals, and
				raised the kiddos, do you think you could get a job that changes the world? Well if you asked Hedy Lamar,
				the answer would be yes. She was truly an overachiever. She was a very successful film star in Germany
				working with Max Reinhardt, but fled fascist Germany for France in 1937. It was not long before she was
				working for Louis B Mayer and Cecil B. DeMilles. Okay! Great! She was a successful actor on two continents.
				Did you know that she was an inventor? Yes! She improved the early traffic stoplight design, made
				substantial aerodynamic improvements on airplane wing design for Howard Hughes, and most importantly she
				worked on and perfected the algorithm that drives modern wireless voice and data communication, frequency
				hopping. Ethical, beautiful, successful, mother of three, and a natural genius. Unfortunately, I can not
				hire her because she passed away in 2000.

				Hmm. Sharon Stone, Meryl Streep, Laura Linney, Hellen Mirren, Judy Dench. So many great choices. The common
				thread is that all of these actors are independent, smart, tenacious, successful, powerful community
				engagement partners, and ultimately great leaders.
